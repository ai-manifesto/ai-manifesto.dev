> The AI Manifesto: Guiding responsible AI in development and collaboration.

The AI Manifesto is a collaborative effort to establish principles for artificial intelligence development and deployment.

## The 5 Principles

1. **Never let an LLM _speak_ for you.** Speak in your own voice. Use AI to clarify your thinking, but ensure the authenticity of your actions.

2. **Never let an LLM _think_ for you.** Own the strategy. Use AI to explore solutions and challenge your assumptions, but remain the architect of your work. Recognize its potential for bias and errors.

3. **Never let an LLM _own_ your work.** Take absolute responsibility for the final result. Never deflect your actions by "The AI said so". The credit and accountability for every contribution remains with you.

4. **Never let an LLM _replace_ your curiosity.** AI enables you to learn and explore more deeply. Use AI as a partner not as an oracle that ends the exploration.

5. **Never let an LLM _discourage_ someone else.** AI is built to empower individuals and lower barriers. It should foster inclusion, not create new forms of gatekeeping.
